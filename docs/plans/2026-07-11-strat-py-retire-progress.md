# STRAT-PY-RETIRE — execution ledger

Companion to `2026-07-11-strat-py-retire-roadmap.md`. Records what has actually been
done as the epic is driven, so a fresh session resumes losslessly. Newest at top of
each phase. Absolute SHAs / versions only.

## Owner directive (2026-07-12, session 70422c49)

- **Soak collapsed.** No other users besides the owner → the calendar soak (Phase 0's
  "7 PASS days ~07-18") is dropped. Cutover proceeds as soon as the work is done.
- **Deletion sequencing: cut over now, delete after a SHORT real-usage window.** Drive
  Phases 0–4 to make TS the sole engine (forge + compose), operate TS-only for real,
  THEN Phase 5 deletes Python. Deletion gated on "TS actually ran as the only engine and
  held," not a calendar. Keep the Python fallback until then (we found engine races in the
  flow-bg work on 2026-07-12, so do not discard the fallback the same stretch we cut over).

## Status snapshot (2026-07-12)

- stratum @ origin/main; TS v0.2.106 (STRAT-TS-FLOW-BG epic COMPLETE this session).
- Critical path to TS-only: 0 → 1 → 4 → 5; Phase 2 (guard done) + Phase 3 feed Phase 4.

## Phase 2 — TS parity (stratum repo)

- **stratum#6 (node ≥26 bin fix) — ✅ DONE + VERIFIED (2026-07-12).** Code fix already
  landed @ 494fa60 (`extraNodeFlags()` in `ts/src/cli/node-flags.mjs` gates
  `--experimental-transform-types` via `process.allowedNodeEnvironmentFlags`; erasable-only
  syntax means type *stripping*, default-on in node ≥24, suffices). Verified on homebrew
  **node 26.0.0**: CLI bin `--help` exits 0; MCP bin answers `initialize` with a valid
  JSON-RPC reply (serverInfo stratum-mcp). D5 Phase-2 entry gate CLEARED.
  - **Residual (non-blocking follow-up):** both bins emit `DEP0205` — `module.register()`
    is deprecated for `module.registerHooks()` (in `ts/src/cli/bootstrap.mjs`). Warning
    only today; a future node major may remove it. Track + fix before it becomes the next
    "#6". Node-22 pin wrapper (`~/bin/stratum-ts`) can be dropped once callers move.
- **STRAT-TS-GUARD — ✅ COMPLETE + PUSHED** (origin/main @ 25fb104, v0.2.97). 5 guard
  tools, cross-engine byte-parity + Python↔TS mutual-exclusion proven. Residual: compose
  `guardBin()` unpin → STRAT-PY-SWEEP row 4 (Phase 4).
- STRAT-TS-PARALLEL — ⏸️ PAUSED (dead-on-arrival; real path = STRAT-TS-PARALLEL-FANOUT post TS-2).
- STRAT-TS-ITER — NEEDS-WIRING (no live caller; engine auto-drives iterate). Confirm a
  consumer before porting the 3 tools.
- STRAT-TS-FLOWCTL — commit/revert KEEP, skip_step thin-KEEP, check_timeouts PARK.
- STRAT-TS-JUDGE-TOOL — ABSORB (judged: ensures over TS judge backend) + 2 deltas
  (budget-ledger wiring, evidence-bounding tests).
